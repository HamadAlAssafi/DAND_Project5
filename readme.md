# (Ford GoBike Data Exploration)
## by (Hamad Sami AlAssafi)


## Dataset

> I have used Ford GoBike Dataset, which are a dataset contains data about bike-racing attributes for approximately 519700 bike.


## Summary of Findings

> 1-It looks like most of the racers have finished the race in between (200 Seconds) to (1000 Seconds)
> 2-It seems that the end and start station latitude is similar, and the most frequent latitude is between (37.7, 37.8) for the start as will as the end
> 3- It seems that the end and start station longitude is similar, and the most frequent longitude is between (-122.6, -122.4) for the start as will as the end.
> 4-We Have two type of users (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual), in our dataset we have up to (400000) subsrcibers and almost (110000) customers is it showns in the bar chart, and the pie chart shows that is (79.21) of the users is (Subscribers)
> 5-Most of the racers starts at San Franciso Ferry Buliding station
> 6-It is looks like the (Subscribers) often finish the race faster than the (Customers)
> 7-It looks like the fastest way to finish the race if you latitude between (37.750) and (37.875)
> 8-It looks like the fastest way to finish the race if you longitude between (-122.44) and (-122.23)
> 9-It is looks like that the most frequent latitude and longitude is between (37.76) and (37.80) for the latitude, (-122.43) and (-122.4) for the longitude
> 10-Most of the (Subscribers) finished the race faster than the (Customers), and the most frequent latitude for the (Subscribers) is (65), and for the the (Customers) is (155)
> 11-Most of the (Subscribers) finished the race faster than the (Customers), and the most frequent longitude for the (Subscribers) is between (215) and (230), and for the the (Customers) is between (170) and (185)



## Key Insights for Presentation

> This presentation shows the most user type, who of these users will finish the trip faster, and why the finish it faster.
> 1-and the most user type we have is the (Subscribers)
> 2-(subsrcibers) is faster than the (Customers)
> 3-the most frequent latitude for the (Subscribers) is (65), and for the the (Customers) is (155),so that why the subscribers is faster than the customers
> 4- In this graphs we will see why the subscribers finishes the trip faster,and the most frequent longitude for the (Subscribers) is between (215) and (230), and for the the (Customers) is between (170) and (185), so that why the subscribers is faster than the customers.
